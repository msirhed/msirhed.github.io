description: Compassion Community Group commissioned Trusst to design a new, public housing development in San Francisco. This 120-unit building features a mix of indoor and outdoor community spaces as well as residential and commercial units. 70% of the buildingâ€™s materials were recycled, and interior design features included reclaimed wood and high ceilings.

education_integration:  Members worked closely with Staff to source recycled materials for this building and to integrate recycled design elements in creative ways. Members worked to balance utility, beauty, and environmentally-friendly practices to create competing proposals for this project.

event_integration: Upon the grand opening of the building, Trusst hosted a building-wide house warming party, where new residents were presented with their unit keys. Local businesses donated housewares, furniture, and decorative items to residents.

charity_tagline: Donations of material goods went to Compassion Community Group to be distributed to their residents.
