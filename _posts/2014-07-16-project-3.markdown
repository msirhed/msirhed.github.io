category: Health Care
tagline: Remodeled a health care facility.
description: St. Andrews Clinic is located in one of New York’s most underprivileged areas and serves 500 patients a day. St. Andrews wished to update their interior design to reflect their mission and state-of-the-art health care. They looked to Trusst to carry out on this vision. Using a warm, inviting color palette, we extensively remodelled their space, while keeping the look of the building’s exterior, a facade that the neighborhood sees as a beacon of reliability and stability. We were able to keep the clinic open at half capacity during the remodelling by building in stages, which ensured that the community wasn’t drastically inconvenienced by the improvements.

education_integration: Our members were involved heavily in the design of St. Andrews, working with a wide range of colors and textures. One group investigated the healing impact of colors, and incorporated this study into St. Andrew’s design.

event_integration: To celebrate the completion of the project, Trusst hosted an opening party for the community. We auctioned off local artists’ work along with that of our photography students, who had spent the semester working on a series focused on the themes of healing and rejuvenation.

charity_tagline: "15% of the proceeds from the auction were donated to 3 local charities:"
charities:
  - St. Andrew’s Fund, benefiting children’s healthcare
  - NY Moms Against Cancer, funding Cancer research
  - Johnson Foundation, subsidizing health coverage for the poor
